# MassDriver

## Overview
**MassDriver**, is a system designed to allow the easy definition of complex systems, typically using microservice archtecture. It allows the creation of multiple levels of nested apps, and encourages reuse of microservices.

### Microservice Architecture
A Microservice typically is a "small" unit of work. The exact meaning of small is left up to the developer or system administrator. While generally microservices should be considers to be a set of components that interconnect via api's using either REST or MessageBus, there is no limitiation of including traditional web or systems infrastrucutre.

### Target Implementaiton For System
The system is designed to be implemented in a Docker/Kubernetes like system, and principally is intended to be used in a OpenShift Enterprise, or OpenShift Origin mode.
